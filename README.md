# Overview
What We Are Learning
We already learnt how to create a functional API in previous lessons. Even if we covered several concepts all the code was written in the same file, which is not best practice. In this lesson, we will start building an API with a similar functionality but with a modular structure.

The first slide will explain configuration files and their use.
